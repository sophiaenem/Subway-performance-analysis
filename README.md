finding out the sales persons recident in the northern region, inquire measures they implemented and convey to the persons in the north.


Transaction analysis 
The goods sold at 0-1000 were the highest sold goods with the count of 218 times, so goods sold from 0-1000 were mainly bought by most people. I recommend that prices of goods within this range should be offered more frequently or make goods within that price range be more available. Customers who spend more could be identified. they can be grouped as premium customers.

New york being the best ship and Milwaukee the lowest ship city. 
 Setting up HQ at the new york to ensure more customers get interested in lower shipping fee encouraging more unacquired customers.
